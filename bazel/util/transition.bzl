# A transition in Bazel is a way to force changes to the way the build is
# evaluated for all dependencies of a given rule.
#
# Imagine the following simple dependency graph:
#
#     ->: depends on
#     a -> b -> c
#
# Normally, if you set `defines` on a, they couldn't apply to b or c because
# they are dependencies of a. There's no way for b or c to know about a's
# settings, because they don't even know a exists!
#
# We can fix this via a transition! If we put a transition in front of `a`
# that sets --copts=-DFOO=42, we're telling Bazel to build a and all of its
# dependencies under that configuration.
#
# Note: Flags must be referenced as e.g. `//command_line_option:copt` in
# transitions.
#
# `declare_transition()` eliminates the frustrating amount of boilerplate. All
# you need to do is provide a set of attrs, and then a `flag_overrides`
# dictionary that tells `declare_transition()` which attrs to pull flag values
# from. The common `src` attr tells the transition which build rule to apply
# the transition to.
